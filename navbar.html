        <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet
            (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text
            to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list
            of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content
            development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security
            configuration, and e-commerce development.</p>

                For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web
                developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller
                organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to
                related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a
                collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three
                kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer.[3]
                Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end
                developers deal with the servers. Since the commercialization of the Web with Tim Berners-Lee[4] developing
                the World Wide Web at CERN, the industry has boomed and has become one of the most used technologies ever.

            Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web
            sites: writing markup and coding.[2] Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make
            content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.
